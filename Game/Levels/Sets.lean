Title "Chapter 2: Sets"

Introduction "
Welcome to Set World!

The elements of the sets in this level will come from a universe called `U`.
To specify that an object `x` belongs to the universe `U`, we write `x : U`.
To specify that `A` is a set of objects from `U`, we write `A : Set U`.
(The terminology used in Lean is that `x` has type `U` and `A` has type `Set U`.)
To say that `x` is an element of `A`, we write `x ∈ A`.
(You can enter the symbol `∈` by typing `\\mem` or `\\in`.)


The notation A ⊆ B means that A is a subset of B.
(To enter the symbol ⊆, type `\\sub`, followed by a space.)
