Title "Assuming Tautologies"


Introduction "A tautology is a proposition or
logical formula that is true, no matter how truth values
are assigned to its component propositional variables and predicates.
Assuming is a proof strategy, but we've already using it! Whenever we
use the law of the excluded middle, we are assuming a tautology because regardless
of what proposition p is assigned to, p ∨ ¬p is always true."

-- any proof using law of excluded middle
