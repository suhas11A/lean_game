World "LogicalEquivalence"
Level 10
Title "Exercise"


Introduction ""

-- apply several logical equivalences to negate some formula, then prove
-- that the negation is true
-- something like exercise 1.18
-- not sure what process of neagting formula would look like
-- would need to introduce thms proved in previous levels and use them
-- could also add another practice level where students are asked to prove some
-- tautology like
-- ∀x ∈ X, [P(x) → Q(x)] ∨ [Q(x) → P(x)]
-- or (∀x ∈ X, P(x) ∨ Q(x) → ∀x ∈ X, P(x) ∨ ∃x ∈ X, Q(x))
