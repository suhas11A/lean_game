potential exercise: (p \imp r) \and (q \imp r) \imp (p \or q \imp r)
outermost operator is \imp becuase it has highest precedence, not \and because it is the first that appears outside of parentheses
proof strategy for p \imp q, assume p and derive q
formulas that are true no matter what values p, q, r take are called tautologies
inverse versus contrapositive, converse of the inverse is the contrapositive
proof by contradiction explained with negation operator
spent time on law of excluded middle and principle of explosion
making an assumption is not same as stating that something is necessarily true. for sqrt(2) ^ sqrt(2) example, we don't have to state if it is rational or irrational, suffices to prove goal in both cases
- maybe it would help to state in general terms:
((p \imp r) \and (\neg p \imp r)) \imp r

- _little_ more explanation that p(a) = p(b) -> a = b is same as uniqueness (there is only one x \in X satisfying p(x))
- free versus bound variables
- density of rationals
