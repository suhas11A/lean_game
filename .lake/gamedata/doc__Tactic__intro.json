 "*(lean docstring)*\\\nIntroduces one or more hypotheses, optionally naming and/or pattern-matching them.\nFor each hypothesis to be introduced, the remaining main goal's target type must\nbe a `let` or function type.\n\n* `intro` by itself introduces one anonymous hypothesis, which can be accessed\n  by e.g. `assumption`.\n* `intro x y` introduces two hypotheses and names them. Individual hypotheses\n  can be anonymized via `_`, or matched against a pattern:\n  ```lean\n  -- ... ⊢ α × β → ...\n  intro (a, b)\n  -- ..., a : α, b : β ⊢ ...\n  ```\n* Alternatively, `intro` can be combined with pattern matching much like `fun`:\n  ```lean\n  intro\n  | n + 1, 0 => tac\n  | ...\n  ```\n",
