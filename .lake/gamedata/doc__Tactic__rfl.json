 "*(lean docstring)*\\\n`rfl` tries to close the current goal using reflexivity.\nThis is supposed to be an extensible tactic and users can add their own support\nfor new reflexive relations.\n\nRemark: `rfl` is an extensible tactic. We later add `macro_rules` to try different\nreflexivity theorems (e.g., `Iff.rfl`).\n",
